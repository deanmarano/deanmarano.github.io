Hi! I'm Dean. I'm a web developer with a lot of passion - for tech, social
action, and life.

## Tech

I've done this for money [for a while](/resume.md).

I'm well versed in a few technologies:

* **Javascript** - my love affair that started in 2007 and has been growing
  with each and every day.  Warts and all, it continues to surprise and delight
  me in just how powerful and expressive it can be.
* **Ruby** - If I'm working with a server-side database, I reach for
  ActiveRecord.  While I have some qualms with the pattern, it's hard to
  compete with the Rails framework for API development. I've worked in Rails
  2.x-5beta, from Ruby EE to the bleeding edge. For synchronous processing, I
  enjoy it's eloquence and simplicity.
* **Chrome** - I started writing my web apps for Opera (I was a die hard fan
  for many years) and transitioned through IE and Firefox, but Chrome Canary is
  currently an irreplacable part of my toolchain. Incredibly strong Dev Tools
  combined with native HTML/JS extensions and packaged apps make it a no
  brainer for a web denizen. I <3 my Chromebook.
* **Linux/Unix** - I'm not the most well versed on the command line, but I can
  hold my own.  I groom [my dotfiles](https://github.com/deanmarano/dotfiles)
  meticulously, and I'm always looking for new ways to speed up my workflow.
  With a killer combo of tmux and vim I'm at home in the terminal.

Other favorites include

* **Markdown** - A passionate follower of CommonMark, I write everything (even
  [shopping lists]](https://gist.github.com/deanmarano/895778216e0612dd1be8))
  in markdown.
* **Ember.js** - For me, the be-all end-all of what a JS framework should be. A
  bit of a fanboy, but I try to keep it under control. I'll talk your ear off
  about it if you give me the chance.
* **Erlang** - Even though I've only done some toy apps, it's helped me reshape
  my thinking about reliable and robust software systems. I'd love to experiment
  more with Erlang and Elixir.
* **LISP/Clojure** - I've written a bit, including some production systems.
  Functional programming can be seen throughout my code, and it's very much due
  to my time between the parens.
* **Node.js** - You had me at Javascript. A few production apps, dabbling in it
  constantly. Most of my favorite tooling is in Node.

## Social Action

In 2011, after two years of working and living in the real world, I saw Sal
Khan's TED talk and promptly switched my life around to try and someday get a
job working at Khan Academy. I started graduate school, got a job at a large
tech company (so I could gain the skills needed to be proficient at my job),
and started mentoring at a software bootcamp. I'd always had the learning bug,
and getting a taste of the teaching bug really opened my eyes. Over the years,
I taught at a school through Citizen Schools, tutored through an afterschool
program, started my career in ed-tech. I believe providing strong education to
underprivledge students is a powerful way to affect positive change. While I
haven't yet reached my goal of KA, I plan on being involved in education in
some way throughout the rest of my life.

## Life

When I'm not typing, I have a guitar in my hands. Music is a large part of my
life, my self expression, and problem solving. Whether it's acoustic, blues,
classic rock, or ambient, I can find something fascinating in almost anything
with rythym. I live for live music and I still buy physical CDs. I recently
picked up a ukulele and have had a hard time putting it down.

In 2015, I started infusing liquors, and have made over 50 different varieties.
From Nutella bourbon to sweet potato vodka, I'm always experimenting with
new flavors and strategies. I love sharing, so let me know what you're into
and I'm sure I can whip something up for you.

I used to be a runner, running three marathons and a 70.4 Ironman, but was
sidelined by a knee injury. I'm still working on recovering, but it's been a
long and slow road. I hope to someday pick it back up, but for now I try to do
a lot of biking and walking.

Nature is always calling, but heard less than I'd like. While I appreciate the
tree-lined streets of my hometown Chicago, I adore the smell of the air in my adopted
second home in Seattle. The mountains, old trees, and open water bring a certain
peace that's hard to find in steel and concrete.
